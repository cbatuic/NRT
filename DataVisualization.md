To display live temperature data from PostgreSQL in Tableau:

1. Install PostgreSQL ODBC driver (if not already installed).
2. Connect Tableau to PostgreSQL by providing server, database, and authentication details.
3. Set the connection to Live (rather than extract) to ensure real-time data fetching.
4. Create visualizations (like time series charts) to represent temperature data over time.
5. Build a dashboard by arranging the visualizations on the canvas.
6. Optionally, set up auto-refresh to keep the dashboard updated at regular intervals.
7. Publish the dashboard to Tableau Server or Tableau Online if sharing with others.
